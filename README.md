# Performance Report
 This script automates website performance analysis by using Lighthouse and Google PageSpeed APIs to measure key metrics (FCP, LCP, CLS, etc.) for both mobile and desktop versions of URLs. It logs results, generates HTML reports, saves data to an SQL Server, and clears log directories. It also performs POST requests to specified URLs with sample data for further processing.
